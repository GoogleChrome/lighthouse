> Dockerfile for running Lighthouse using full Chrome and xvfb instead of
headless Chrome.

If you'd rather use full "headful" Chrome, build an image using this folder's
`Dockerfile`.

**Dockerfile image size: ~820MB.**

Instructions for building/running can be found in the main [README](../README.md).
