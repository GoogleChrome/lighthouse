# General support is not provided in GitHub issues!

Issues on GitHub are intended to be related to problems with Build Tracker itself. It's often seen as rude to ask basic usage questions here. Please make sure you read the documentation thoroughly and try searching the web for your problem. You are not likely to receive support with how to use it here 😁.
