## Problem

<!--
Explain the problem you'd like to have Build Tracker solve.
When trying to solve more solutions with Build Tracker, please keep in mind
some of the following goals of the project:
* Be lightweight: small project size (single-digit KiBs, gzipped)
* Be easy: too many options in an API can become confusing
* Be clear: the intended purpose of every method should be obvious
* Is it easy to do this in "userland"? Would it be better off done there?
-->

## Proposed solution

<!--
Explain a possible way to solve the problem. Keep in mind that there may be
alternate ways to do the same thing. Try to think of those and weight
the tradeoffs.
