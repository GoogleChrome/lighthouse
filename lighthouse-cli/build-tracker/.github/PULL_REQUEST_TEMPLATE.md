# Solution

<!--
Explain your approach. Sometimes it helps to justify your approach against some others that you didn't choose to explain why yours is better.

When trying to solve more solutions with Build Tracker, please keep in mind some of the following goals of the project:
* Be lightweight: small package sizes (single-digit KiBs, gzipped)
* Be easy: too many options in an API can become confusing
* Be clear: the intended purpose of every method should be as obvious as possible
* Is it easy to do this in "userland"? Would it be better off done there?
