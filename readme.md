> Lighthouse analyzes web apps and web pages, collecting modern performance metrics and insights on developer best practices.

## Using Lighthouse in Chrome DevTools

Lighthouse is integrated directly into the Chrome Developer Tools, under the "Audits" panel.

**Installation**: install [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser).

**Run it**: open Chrome DevTools, select the Audits panel, and hit "Run audits".

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/e7997b3db01de3553d8cb208a40f3d4fd350195c/assets/example_dev_tools.png" alt="Lighthouse integration in Chrome DevTools" width="500px">

## Using the Chrome extension

The Chrome extension was available prior to Lighthouse being available in Chrome Developer Tools, and offers similar functionality.

**Installation**: [install the extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lighthouse/blipmdconlkpinefehnmjammfjpmpbjk) from the Chrome Web Store.

**Run it**: follow the [extension quick-start guide](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/#extension).

## Using the Node CLI

The Node CLI provides the most flexibility in how Lighthouse runs can be configured and reported. Users who want more advanced usage, or want to run Lighthouse in an automated fashion should use the Node CLI.

_Lighthouse requires Node 10 LTS (10.13) or later._

**Installation**:

```sh
npm install -g lighthouse
# or use yarn:
# yarn global add lighthouse
```

**Run it**: `lighthouse https://airhorner.com/`

By default, Lighthouse writes the report to an HTML file. You can control the output format by passing flags.

##### Output Examples

```sh
lighthouse
# saves `./<HOST>_<DATE>.report.html`

lighthouse --output json
# json output sent to stdout

lighthouse --output html --output-path ./report.html
# saves `./report.html`

# NOTE: specifying an output path with multiple formats ignores your specified extension for *ALL* formats
lighthouse --output json --output html --output-path ./myfile.json
# saves `./myfile.report.json` and `./myfile.report.html`

lighthouse --output json --output html
# saves `./<HOST>_<DATE>.report.json` and `./<HOST>_<DATE>.report.html`

lighthouse --output-path=~/mydir/foo.out --save-assets
# saves `~/mydir/foo.report.html`
# saves `~/mydir/foo-0.trace.json` and `~/mydir/foo-0.devtoolslog.json`

lighthouse --output-path=./report.json --output json
# saves `./report.json`
```

##### Lifecycle Examples
You can run a subset of Lighthouse's lifecycle if desired via the `--gather-mode` (`-G`) and  `--audit-mode` (`-A`) CLI flags.

```sh
lighthouse http://example.com -G
# launches browser, collects artifacts, saves them to disk (in `./latest-run/`) and quits

lighthouse http://example.com -A
# skips browser interaction, loads artifacts from disk (in `./latest-run/`), runs audits on them, generates report

lighthouse http://example.com -GA
# Normal gather + audit run, but also saves collected artifacts to disk for subsequent -A runs.


# You can optionally provide a custom folder destination to -G/-A/-GA. Without a value, the default will be `$PWD/latest-run`.
lighthouse -GA=./gmailartifacts https://gmail.com
```


#### Notes on Error Reporting

The first time you run the CLI you will be prompted with a message asking you if Lighthouse can anonymously report runtime exceptions. The Lighthouse team uses this information to detect new bugs and avoid regressions. Opting out will not affect your ability to use Lighthouse in any way. [Learn more](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/blob/master/docs/error-reporting.md).

## Using the Node module
You can also use Lighthouse programmatically with the Node module.

Read [Using Lighthouse programmatically](./docs/readme.md#using-programmatically) for help getting started.\
Read [Lighthouse Configuration](./docs/configuration.md) to learn more about the configuration options available.

## Viewing a report

Lighthouse can produce a report as JSON or HTML.

HTML report:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/443ff2c8a297dfd2297dfaca86c4966a87c8574a/assets/example_audit.png" alt="Lighthouse example audit" width="500px">

### Online Viewer

Running Lighthouse with the `--output=json` flag generates a JSON dump of the run.
You can view this report online by visiting <https://googlechrome.github.io/lighthouse/viewer/>
and dragging the file onto the app. You can also use the "Export" button from the
top of any Lighthouse HTML report and open the report in the
[Lighthouse Viewer](https://googlechrome.github.io/lighthouse/viewer/).

In the Viewer, reports can be shared by clicking the share icon in the top
right corner and signing in to GitHub.

> **Note**: shared reports are stashed as a secret Gist in GitHub, under your account.

## Develop

Read on for the basics of hacking on Lighthouse. Also, see [Contributing](./CONTRIBUTING.md)
for detailed information.

### Setup

```sh
# yarn should be installed first

git clone https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse

cd lighthouse
yarn
yarn build-all
```

If changing audit output, you'll likely also need to have the protocol-buffer compiler installed. See the [official installation instructions](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf#protocol-compiler-installation) or consult your [favorite package manager](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/protobuf) for your OS.

### Run

```sh
node lighthouse-cli http://example.com
# append --chrome-flags="--no-sandbox --headless --disable-gpu" if you run into problems connecting to Chrome
```

> **Getting started tip**: `node --inspect-brk lighthouse-cli http://example.com` to open up Chrome DevTools and step
through the entire app. See [Debugging Node.js with Chrome
DevTools](https://medium.com/@paul_irish/debugging-node-js-nightlies-with-chrome-devtools-7c4a1b95ae27#.59rma3ukm)
for more info.

### Tests

```sh
# lint and test all files
yarn test

# watch for file changes and run tests
#   Requires http://entrproject.org : brew install entr
yarn watch

## run linting, unit, and smoke tests separately
yarn lint
yarn unit
yarn smoke

## run tsc compiler
yarn type-check
```

Yes! Details in [Lighthouse configuration](./docs/configuration.md).

### How does Lighthouse use network throttling, and how can I make it better?

Good question. Network and CPU throttling are applied by default in a Lighthouse run. The network
attempts to emulate slow 4G connectivity and the CPU is slowed down 4x from your machine's default speed. If you
prefer to run Lighthouse without throttling, you'll have to use the CLI and disable it with the
`--throttling.*` flags mentioned above.

Read more in our [guide to network throttling](./docs/throttling.md).

### Are results sent to a remote server?

Nope. Lighthouse runs locally, auditing a page using a local version of the Chrome browser installed the
machine. Report results are never processed or beaconed to a remote server.

### How do I author custom audits to extend Lighthouse?

> **Tip**: see [Lighthouse Architecture](./docs/architecture.md) for more information
on terminology and architecture.

Lighthouse can be extended to run custom audits and gatherers that you author.
This is great if you're already tracking performance metrics in your site and
want to surface those metrics within a Lighthouse report.

If you're interested in running your own custom audits, check out our
[Custom Audit Example](./docs/recipes/custom-audit) over in recipes.

### How do I contribute?

We'd love help writing audits, fixing bugs, and making the tool more useful!
See [Contributing](./CONTRIBUTING.md) to get started.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to

      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
